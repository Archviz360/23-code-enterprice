Introducing a new open-source IDE for everyone. i invite all developers skilled in Cursor coding to contribute and help build a thriving open-source community.  23 Code Enterprise doesn’t aim to compete with other free IDEs but rather to offer an alternative choice for those seeking a versatile and supportive environment for their coding projects.

**Plans for 23 Code Enterprise**

I am building 23 Code Enterprise as an open-source IDE for everyone—a platform where collaboration is key, and all contributions are welcome. If you have skills in development and want to be part of creating a versatile, open-source coding community, I would love for you to join me. It is important, however, that contributions are stable and error-free, especially when making updates or adding new features, to ensure a smooth experience for all users.

Below is an overview of my plans for 23 Code Enterprise:

1. **Modern UI Design**  
   My aim is to create a user interface that is not only sleek and visually appealing but also highly intuitive and user-friendly. A modern UI will provide developers with a productive environment that enhances the overall coding experience, allowing them to focus on what they do best—creating great software. I am currently in need of talented UI designers to help craft this vision and refine the visual style.

2. **Versatile Workspace Compatibility**  
   I want 23 Code Enterprise to be a truly universal IDE—one that can seamlessly support all types of development workspaces. Whether you are developing a game in Unreal Engine or Unity, creating software applications, or building web projects, this IDE will offer the tools and support you need. My goal is to provide flexibility, ensuring that 23 Code Enterprise is adaptable to any workflow, regardless of your technology stack or project type.

3. **Extension Marketplace**  
   Extensions are a key part of my strategy to make 23 Code Enterprise a powerful and adaptable IDE. I plan to implement an extension marketplace where developers can explore, install, and share extensions to enhance their workflow. Customizability is one of my top priorities, and I want users to have the ability to extend the IDE's capabilities in ways that suit their individual needs. I encourage developers with experience in plugin development to contribute to building this marketplace.

4. **Website Development Support**  
   In addition to supporting game and software development, 23 Code Enterprise will also offer features specifically tailored to web developers. This IDE will include tools and integrations to streamline the creation and deployment of websites, making it a one-stop solution for developers working across different domains.

**Join Me in Building 23 Code Enterprise**  
I welcome anyone with coding skills who is passionate about building a new, community-driven IDE. The use of AI tools such as ChatGPT, CodeLlama by Meta, and others is encouraged, as we will leverage AI as a helpful assistant to enhance our development process. At this stage, the most crucial skills are software development and UI design, as I work to create a stable, feature-rich IDE with a user-friendly interface.

Contributors are reminded that stability is key: updates must be tested thoroughly to ensure they are error-free and function smoothly, so we can maintain a reliable platform for everyone involved.

Lastly, please note that the current UI and overall look are placeholders—they are not representative of the final product design. I am continually working to evolve the design to meet modern standards and provide a polished user experience.

Together, let's build something that offers developers another great option—an IDE that is open, collaborative, and powerful.

I am hoping to be able to release 23 Code Enterprise in 2025/2026. Additionally, I will create a Discord server where we can all communicate and collaborate effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8+

### Installing

1. Install JavaScript dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build and preview the production bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
4. Launch the experimental Tkinter editor:
   ```bash
   python "23 code enterprice.py"
   ```

Collaboration features rely on Yjs signaling and require internet access.

### Testing
